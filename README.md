# vpn-azure
A cloud based openvpn vpn server. This project should be my entry into reverse engineering.
My first approach is to setup a openvpn server in the an azure virtual desktop.
Afterwards I would also like to create a Docker container Image which can be pulled and used on every linux server.

## Setting up a Azure Virtual Desktop

## Install a openVPN Server on an Azure Virtual Desktop
1. `sudo apt install openvpn` on the Linux server.
